## Getting the Source Code

The first step is to get the source code and be able to explore it through a terminal window.

The source code is available with every release on the [release page on Github](https://github.com/Theeoi/notion-recurring-tasks/releases). Download the Source code and extract it to an appropriate location.

Open a terminal and navigate to the source code. There are multiple ways of doing this but an easy option is to navigate to the extracted folder in a file explorer, right click in the folder and select 'Open in terminal'. If successful you should be able to to type `ls` and see the contents of the directory.
