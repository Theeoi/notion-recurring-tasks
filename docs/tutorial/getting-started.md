# Getting Started

Congratulations on deciding to get started using the Notion Recurring Tasks software!

The road ahead can be a little complex if you are not used to working with APIs and Notion databases. But this tutorial will break down the process in four easy-to-follow steps. Once you have completed this tutorial the software and your Notion will be set up for continous use without complications.

And remember, if you have trouble following this tutorial or have any other questions please do not hessitate to reach out through the [support page](../index.md#support).

## Getting the Software

The first step is to get the software onto your computer. There are 3 ways of doing this where the first two revolve around downloading (or cloning) the source code. From there you can either [install the software](install-from-source.md) or [build an executable](build-from-source.md). The third option is to download an already built executable.

For the purposes of this tutorial we will be downloading an already built executable of the software. You should *always* be cautious of downloading an executable from the internet! So if you do not trust the files you are about to download then it is recommended to instead choose one of the above two options.

You can find the software on the [release page on Github](https://github.com/Theeoi/notion-recurring-tasks/releases). On the various releases there are assets as shown in the image above.

The source code assets contain a copy of the source code at the time of the release. The other assets are compressed executables of the software (marked in red) built for specific operating systems (windows for Windows and unix for Linux/MacOS). Download the one appropriate for you. After downloading, extract the `.zip` to an appropriate location.

> :grey_exclamation: **NOTE**: For Windows users, NordVPNs file protection service (and possibly other similar services) will immediately delete `notion-recurring-tasks.exe`. Please disable such services before extracting.

If done successfully, you should now have the `notion-recurring-tasks` directory with the content shown below and be able to run it.
