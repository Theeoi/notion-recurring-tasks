# Getting Started

Congratulations on deciding to get started using the Notion Recurring Tasks software!

The road ahead can be a little complex if you are not used to working with APIs and Notion databases. But this tutorial will break down the process in four easy-to-follow steps. Once you have completed this tutorial the software and your Notion will be set up for continous use without complications.

And remember, if you have trouble following this tutorial or have any other questions please do not hessitate to reach out through the [support page](../index.md#support).

## Downloading the Software

The first step is to get the software onto your computer. For the purposes of this tutorial we will be downloading the executable version of the software. But of course, you could always download the source code directly or clone the Github repository if you prefer. Downloading the source code however is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

You can find the software on the [release page on Github](https://github.com/Theeoi/notion-recurring-tasks/releases). On the various releases there are assets as shown in the image above.

The source code assets contain a copy of the source code at the time of the release. The other assets are compressed executables of the software built for specific operating systems (windows for Windows and unix for Linux/MacOS). Download the one appropriate for you. After downloading, extract the `.zip` to access the directory with the software.
