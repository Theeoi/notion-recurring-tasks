# Automatically Running the Software

Tasks can only recur when the Notion Recurring Tasks software is executed. Without automating the software execution, you must manually run the software every time you want your tasks to update. By automating this step you can truly achieve the set-and-forget goal recurring tasks should be.

There are many options available for automatically calling software. Below are a collection of options categorized after operating system.
