# Welcome to the Notion Recurring Tasks Documentation

> [Notion Recurring Tasks](https://github.com/Theeoi/notion-recurring-tasks) is a program for achieving recurring tasks in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

Notion is a great productivity tool for tracking goals, projects and tasks. However, achieving recurring tasks (tasks whos due date repeats at a set interval) is a hassle and requires manual intervention without external tools. Thanks to the Notion API we can access our task data programatically and make specific tasks recur automatically. The [Notion Recurring Tasks](https://github.com/Theeoi/notion-recurring-tasks) program can be connected to a tasks database in Notion and update the Status and Due Date of these tasks accordingly.

## Getting Started [Quickly]

The program is available two ways; either by downloading an executable or running it from the source code. The easiest option is to download an executable.

No matter which option you choose some setup will be required of you. Namely, getting a Notion API key for the program to use and setting up the Notion database containing your (recurring) tasks.

If you are setting up the project for the first time you can read the full [Getting Started Tutorial](tutorial/getting-started.md) to get started.
