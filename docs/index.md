# Welcome to the Notion Recurring Tasks Documentation

> [Notion Recurring Tasks](https://github.com/Theeoi/notion-recurring-tasks) is software for achieving recurring tasks in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).

Notion is a great productivity tool for tracking goals, projects and tasks. However, achieving recurring tasks (tasks whos due date repeats at a set interval) is a hassle and requires manual intervention without external tools. Thanks to the Notion API we can access our task data programatically and make specific tasks recur automatically. The [Notion Recurring Tasks](https://github.com/Theeoi/notion-recurring-tasks) software can be connected to a tasks database in Notion and update the Status and Due Date of these tasks accordingly.
